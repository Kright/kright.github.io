Files in this repo were converted from my .md files from [another repo](https://github.com/Kright/my-articles) by script in directory `_prerocessing_code`

Just because github pages have some strange demands - placing images to assets directory, placing posts to `_posts` directory with date in name, naming languages in code blocks in lowercase symbols like "```scala" and etc.
